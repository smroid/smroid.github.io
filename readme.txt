The ./cedar and ./updater directories are used by Hopper's OTA updating system.
The bench_setup.py script also uses these by default.

The testing/cedar and testing/updater subdirectories can be used as an
alternative updating root by the bench_setup.py script to evaluate an update
prior to making it available to Hoppers in the field.
